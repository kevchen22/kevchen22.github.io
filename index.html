		<h2>Welcome to my webpage! Here I will be displaying all the work that I have done so far in my exciting career change towards software engineering, as well as my adventures!</h2>
</div>


<p id="intro">As you probably know by now, my name is Kevin. I was born in Boston, Massachusetts and grew up in the towns of Malden and Andover. I attended high school at Andover High School and then continued my education at Bryant University, where I graduated in 2019. I am currently pursuing a career change towards tech, more specifically Software Engineering. I used to be a Staff Accountant for a franchise of Dunkin Donuts that owned about 35 stores in the Boston area. Excited for what the future holds!</p>

	This is a cool article that the Boston Globe wrote about me while I was playing football my senior year in high school. (Yes, I peaked in High School) </a>

<p id="caption"> These are just some of the more memorable pictures I have in recent years. On the left is a picture from high school as I am on my way to my first touchdown to a very memorable senior year after years of hard work. The middle picture is from spring break in college with my college roommates at Daytona Beach (I have more pictures of the trip on the <a href="pages/aboutme.html"> Adventures & About Me </a> tab). On the right is a picture of when I was running track in one of my first meets at Bryant Univeristy (if you click on the image you can see that I still hold a Top 10 60m dash time at the University).</p>

<ul>
	<li>I love sports, I have always grown up around sports, starting with football from 5th - 12th grade. I also ran track from 9th grade - sophomore year in college.</li>
	<li>I was a Finance major in college; one of my favorite projects I worked on was pitching a stock to my classmates and teachers. I helped manage the technology sector for my school's investing portfolio. My team and I pitched Microsoft as a stock for us to buy and my other classmates and teachers agreed to buy it!</li>
	<li>I just spent 2.5 years working at a franchise of Dunkin' Donuts as an Accountant. They owned 35 stores in the Greater Boston area. The office I was working in had a commissary in the back where we made our own donuts to distribute to our stores. I ate a lot of donuts!! My favorite donut is definitely the Boston Kreme.</li>
