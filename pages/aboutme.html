  <h3> Blue Hills Reservation in Milford, MA. </h3>

  <p> I had the luxury of taking some time off in between my work and when I start my class at Per Scholas. On a beautiful sunnny day, I decided to go on a solo hike (my second hike ever). It was one of the most satisfying and rewarding experiences I have been on and now I have a new hobby!</p>

  <h3> Hiking at Mount Washington with my college roommates. </h3>

  <p> This was the first hike I have ever been on. In late September of 2019 my college roommates and I decided to go camping (my first time camping as well). It was a challenge to get to the top but I'm glad we stuck it out until the end. </p>

  <h3> Spring Break in 2018 at Daytona Beach </h3>

  <p> In my Junior year of college, my roommates and I went to Daytona Beach for spring break. It was also coincidentally during bike week which we didn't know about, so it was a plus to see all these cool motorcycles around town (except for when we were trying to sleep, no need for an alarm clock)! We drove all the way down for the trip (22 hour drive one way), but it was definitely worth it.</p>

  <h2> Hobbies </h2>
<ul>
    <li>I love spending time outdoors (as long as my terrible allergies aren't making me miserable). I like going on hikes, kayaking, and going to the beach (as you might be able to tell from my pictures).</li>
    <li>I enjoy playing video games in my free time. I play games such as NBA 2K, Call of Duty, Battlefield, and so on.</li>
    <li>I love going to the gym as much as I can. It's almost Summer, got to get the beach body ready!</li>
    <li>I love watching and playing sports, although these days I'm a lot better at watching sports. My favorite sports are football, basketball, MMA and baseball. I'll get around to hockey eventually!
